Macaw provides the same flexibility as your favorite image editor but also writes semantic HTML and remarkably succinct CSS. It's time to expect more from a web design tool. [Check it out] (http://macaw.co). I often use Macaw to knock up proof of concepts for clients before I hand code them and wanted to give back to the community. This repo will be a place in which I share all websites I build with Macaw. These sites are by no means finished as I built them sheerly for design purposes, but I hope they help anyway!
